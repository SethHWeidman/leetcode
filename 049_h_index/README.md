Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher
received for their `ith` paper, return *the researcher's h-index*.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of
`h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at
least `h` times.
