# This was my first problem ever using bit manipulation! There are a few key "tricks" to know that
# can be combined to solve this problem: if `n` is a binary number
# 1. `n & 1` produces the rightmost digit of `n`
# 2. n <<= 1 shifts the binary characters of `n` to the left, multiplying the underlying number by
#    2, and adding a `0` to the right of the binary representation
# 3. n | [0|1] will set the rightmost character of `n` to be [0|1], if the rightmost character is
#    `0`
#
# In this problem, we'll combine 2 and 3 to shift the binary characters of `n` to the left and then
# `|` with the rightmost character that we've popped off another binary number
#
# 4. n >>= 1 shifts the binary characters of `n` to the right, dividing the underlying decimal
#    number by 2 and dropping the remainder
