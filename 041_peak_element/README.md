# Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array
contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to
be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.
